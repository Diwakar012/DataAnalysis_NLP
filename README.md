# GitHub-Bug-Prediction-Challenge
I'm creating this project to find Bugs,Attributes and Questions from analysing GitHub title and texts using
- Natural Language Processing
- Feature extraction from raw text using TF-IDF, CountVectorizer
- Using Word Embedding to represent words as vectors
- Using Pretrained models like Transformers, BERT
- Optimizing accuracy score as a metric to generalize well on unseen data
Also i'll be representing data using Word Cloud and SunBurst Pie chart .
